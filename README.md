# CUDA-Batch-Image-Processor
A  GPU-accelerated image processing tool built with CUDA 11.8 and OpenCV, capable of processing hundreds of images in batch mode. The project demonstrates CUDA kernels for scaling and filtering images, with efficient memory handling and multi-threaded execution. Includes a Makefile and CLI for flexible execution.
